<h2 id='thoughts'>My Thoughts on Diablo 2, Diablo 3, Diablo 4, and other ARPGs.</h2>

Quick summary of popular ARPGs:
<ul>
<li><b>Diablo 1:</b> Blizzard's <i>groundbreaking</i> game, (or one person's <i>duping</i> gaming)</li>
<li><b>Diablo 2:</b> One person's <i>clicking</i> game,</li>
<li><b>Diablo 3:</b> One person's <i>drinking</i> game,</li>
<li><b>Diablo 4:</b> One person's <i>backtracking</i> game,</li>
<li><b>Diablo Immortal:</b> Blizzard's <i>banking</i> game,</li>
<li><b>Path of Exile:</b> One person's <i>linking</i> game,</li>
<li><b>Path of Exile 2:</b> GGG's <i>bushwhacking</i> game.</li>
<li><b>Grim Dawn:</b> One person's <i>thinking</i> game.</li>
<li><b>Last Epoch:</b> One person's <i>swinking</i> game.</li>
</ul>

Jokes aside, play what YOU find FUN.<br>
(And yes, it is possible to actually like <i>both</i> Diablo 2 and Diablo 3 regardless of what fanboys say.)
<pre>

=== <span class='fhr'>Diablo 2</span> ===
EASILY one of the top ten greatest games of all time (GOAT). Why have I been playing 24 years? <span class='rune'>Itemization.</span>

* Itemization means almost every set/unique/runeword item can have a build based around it
* Uniques are build defining and can be BiS (Best-in-Slot) for multiple characters
* Multiple currencies to collect/trade/use:
  * chipped gems (rip CCB)
  * perfect gems
  * runes
  * keys
  * organs
  * small charms
  * torches (medium charm)
  * grand charms
  * set items
  * uniques
  * rares
* Trading
* Holy Grail (collect every unique item)
* PvP (Player vs Player) include LLD (Low Level Dueling)
* 7 Different classes each with 3+ builds
* End-game content such as Uber Tristram
* Speed running
* Outfitting my mules
* Gambling / Gold Farming
* Softcore and Hardcore (nothing will cause you to clench your butt cheeks like almost dying in HC!)
* Choice of playing Classic or Expansion
* QoL Mods such as loot filter + map reveal

D2 with PlugY + maphack is a dream to play.

D2 is the game we play while we wait for our next favorite game to come out.

=== <span class='fhr'>Diablo 2 Resurrected</span> ===
Graphics: Asolutely beautiful graphics with 60+ FPS.
Gameplay: Thankfully Blizzard/Vicarious Visions didn't screw up this remaster.

Good:

* Increased stash size to 10x10 and 4 stash tabs (one private, 3 shared)
* Beautiful graphics
* Higher resolution
* 60 FPS
* Can up set items
* Offline <span>/players #</span>
* Offline Uber-Diablo via 1 SOJ
* Can toggle between Legacy and Remastered graphics
* Option to cast-skill-on-use
* Gamepad support
* Cross-platform online characters
* Extended Character Details panel
* End game <b>Terror Zones</b> (random zone every hour is at max level of that difficulty)
* Sunder charms to break monster immunity

Bad:

* No LAN play (multiplayer is bullshit Online only)
* Still no loot filter to customize color and labels of items
* No PlugY support
* Limited online character slots
* ebug is fixed :-/

Rune stacking and Gem stacking, sadly, is still missing, but forgivable.

If there is only 1 thing I could ask for: Where is my native D2R loot filter with custom colors and names already?

One of the best map seeds for normal Stony Field + Dark Wood: 456974393


=== <span class='fhr'>Diablo 3</span> ===
Utter garbage on release (RMAH, bad drop rate, bastardization of uniques, no rifts), but <i>finally</i> turned in a good game.

Indigo Gaming has a fantastic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCRzuvwMDUs">Diablo III: A Cautionary Tale | 12 Years of Development Hell</a> documentary on what the hell happened with D3.

The classic <a href="https://www.diablowiki.net/images/b/b4/Art_controversy_01.jpg">How it looks vs How it should look like</a> is only one sign of the initial problem.

Diablo 3's uniques are bad design due to:

* Having stats being based on the class played when the item drops, and
* The same item can have multiple level requirements.

This ironically <b>dilutes</b> uniques making them <i>less</i> unique!

Season 28's <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/season-28-altar-of-rites-effects-and-mechanics">Altar of Rites</a> demonstrates why the base game, unfortunately, is still bad: <span class='rune'>So many missing QoL in vanilla D3.</span>

* No auto salvage for whites, blues, yellows
* No auto gold pickup (unless) you have a pet
* No auto pickup for rift / greater rift orbs
* No auto pickup for Death's Breath
* Low mob density in non-rifts
* Bounty rewards are still too low
* Death Breath's low drop rate  (DB x2 + Sage's Set on NPC is PERFECT.)

The Altar of Rights should be a permanent addition to the game IMHO.

Why are my characters slots so limited? I want a FULL roster of both Softcore and Hardcore characters.  When is PC getting the console/gamepad UI?
<strong>STOP giving me Carpal Tunnel </strong>on PC already!


=== <span class='fhr'>Diablo 4</span> ===
<b>Graphics:</b> Blizzard always has beautiful graphics. (Turn sharpness up to 50.)
<b>Music:</b> Is OK.  No favorite tracks like D2 or D3's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYxngWoiWhE">Ruins of Sescheron (0008)</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX-EBFyUPrM">Chains of Fate</a>
<b>Gameplay:</b> Meh.  A gothic re-skinned Diablo Immortal with Diablo 3 mechanics and Diablo 2 loot (minus the blatant Diablo "Immoral" greed.)
<b>Verdict:</b> 5/10. Wait for sale; go play D2R, Grim Dawn, or even D3 (Season 28) in the meantime.

Good:
* <strike>No MTX (yet) from what I've seen.  (Horse Armor DLC?)</strike>
* Veteran difficulty is good.
* Pinned Location shows the path on both the map and mini-map.
* Optional side quests.
* Gamepad support.
* Can instantly switch between mouse/keyboard & gamepad anytime.
* Stash Tabs are available and cost in-game gold.
* Two ways to leave a dungeon, use an emote (Leave Dungeon) or bring up the map and click on the stairs.
* Retains Diablo 3's Armory, er, Wardrobe.
* Retains Diablo 3's Blood Shards, er, Obols for gambling from Lizveth.
* Separate inventory for Equipment, Consumables, and Quests.  You listening GGG???
* Monsters are automatically scaled up/down PER player.
* No ridiculous millions of DPS like Diablo 3.
* Map has Legend for (most) icons.
* Can switch map between world and dungeon.
* Dynamic group events.  Guild Wars 2 says: <i>"Welcome to 2012."</i>
* Vistas. Guild Wars 2 says: <i>"Welcome to 2012."</i>
* Varied chasm crossing: Jumping, climbing/dropping, horizontal rope ladder, or slide.
* Potions can be upgraded.

Bad:

* Over-priced MTX
* Movement speed is WAY too slow.
* Too much backtracking in dungeons.
* Dungeons are too repetitive.
* You CAN leave a dungeon but why do I have to bring up the emote/map for this instead of clicking a pillar at the end?
* Boring story.
* The Butcher is too hard on Veteran.
* The Butcher disappears if you fail.
* Clicking on X to move item to stash doesn't automatically move the inventory cursor to the next right slot.
* No button to stack all items from inventory to stash.
* No button to move all gems from inventory to stash.
* No dedicated stash tab for gems.
* No offline play.  The excuse is piracy and cheating but not everyone has a good, stable internet connection.
* Forced scrolling on skill tree, abilities, is dumb.
* There IS a map legend but it is called "Filter" not "Filter/Map Legend".
* Map Filter doesn't work inside dungeon.
* Why do bears drop gold???  This is almost as stupid as Diablo 3's vases dropping gold in heaven.
* Auto drop of Quest items (Tower Key) if you leave the area. WHY???
* Must manually click on waypoint to unlock, no auto unlock by proximity.

Ugly:

* Stash and Blacksmith are too separated. (See below.)
* 40 minutes of Login Queue Simulator isn't fun.
* Rubberbanding isn't fun.
* Hanging on a loading screen.
* Constant crashes when loading dungeons.
* Invisible Walls.

Why is the stash and blacksmith being separated bad game design?

One of the problems with realism is that it isn't fun.

In D2, D3, and D4 your town portal (TP) is in the center of town.

In D2 your stash is 1/2 screen away from the TP and the blacksmith is 1 screen away.

In D3 your stash is 1/2 screen away, blacksmith is 1/2 screen away.

In D4 your stash can be found inside a inn 1 screen away (NW) and the Blacksmith is about 2 screens away (SE).  All this extra running around
along with the slow movement speed DRAINS the fun of the core ARPG game loop:

* Kill shit,
* Get phat loot,
* Go to town, sell crap, salvage gear.
* Rinse-and-Repeat

Yes, goblins exist in D4:
